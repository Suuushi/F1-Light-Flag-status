Welcome 

This are my scripts for driving a LED strip that changes according to the current Flag status and a seperate LED strip as a Formula 1 Lap counter.

Those scripts were developed and tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 B, that runs the "Webscraper" script and gets the necessary data, and an Arduino Uno that controlls the LED strip. But theoretically they should run on all newer and older models of their kind.
Due to problems with the Adafruit library on the Raspberry
